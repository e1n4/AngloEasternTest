# Anglo Eastern Test

This repository contains the code for the Anglo Eastern Back End Challenge. 
The goal of this challenge is to build a solution comprised of REST APIs that finds the closest port to a given ship and calculates the estimated arrival time based on velocity and geolocation (longitude and latitude) of given ship.

## Features
1. Add users to the system.
2. See all users in the system.
3. Update ships assigned to a user.
4. Add ships to the system.
5. See all ships in the system.
6. See ships assigned to a specific user.
7. See ships unassigned in the system.
8. Update velocity of a ship.
9. See the closest port to a ship with estimated arrival time to the port together with relevant details.
